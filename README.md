Project Neltharion, as most recently existed in October 2023.
This project is the result of four years of veteran player collaboration, with a focus on endgame replay value and solving long-standing problems.
We implented features, systems, checks, and rules that never existed on blizzard but made a point to keep the game recognizable on the surface to avoid negative effects on players looking for a strictly blizzlike server.

This release is "final", as there will be no further support by myself or under the Project Neltharion name.
The final product is not perfect, as finding more imperfections than you can fix is a natural part of reverse engineering a game. 
The 4 year changelog may be impressive, but our project also started with a source we felt, at the time, was 'almost' complete before spending 4 years working on it.

"What is the core based off?"
- 2019 beta launch was a Chimera of OMFG private-leaked core and Paragon-WoW (FR) scripts. I cannot link as I am not the one who sourced them.
- Anticheat pulled from Azerothcore WOTLK and fitted to cataclysm by Dandi
- M+ System pulled from Legion by Traesh
- All focus-content scripts and systems received hundreds if not thousands of hours of polishing work.

Focused Content:
- Endgame 85 Gameplay Loop
- Critical Systems & QOL
- Starting & chokepoint quest zones

Neglected Content (Original to source cores):
- Pre-Cata Dungeons & Raids
- Quest zones where leveling in them is optional
- Profession Gathering
