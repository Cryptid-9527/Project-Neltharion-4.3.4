Project Neltharion, as most recently existed in October 2023.
Published for anyone interested in running a decent cataclysm experience.

This project is the result of four years of veteran player collaboration, with a focus on endgame replay value and solving long-standing problems. For the full public changelog leading up to the october 6 2023 release, check the file next to the main readme.




Anticheat (Mobility)
We are confident the anticheat we’re introducing should completely discourage the use of mobility hacks ingame. This anticheat has been rigorously tested and fine-tuned to handle even the most absurd types of legitimate movements while still detecting:
•	Airwalking (disable gravity)
•	Fly Hacking
•	Speed hacking
•	Movements while stunned
•	Waterwalking
•	Teleporting
•	Low gravity hacks
•	Given the effectiveness of the mobility anticheat and the teams’ experience as players, we expect cheaters to resort to other means. 
For security reasons, we will not disclose details of other systems waiting for them.
PvP: 
•	Spells:
Multi-GCD spell queueing; Most servers only have active-cast queueing or single-GCD queueing. Our spell queueing allows multiple GCD category queueing.
PvP fights are only enjoyable as the spells involved, therefore spells have been a major focus of development. [link bigbigbig log]
•	Dueling:
Attacking an opponent in an active duel will not flag for PvP in any circumstance. 
The following areas are now ‘supported’ duel zones:  Outside Stormwind (South), Outside Orgrimmar (south), Goldshire, Gallywix pleasure palace, Gurubashi arena.
Duels taking place in a supported duel zone will grant a health, power, and cooldown reset.
•	Arenas:
Ready Crystals have been added to arena starting rooms to start matches faster. 
Wargames have been implemented on neltharion.
•	Crossfaction battlegrounds 
To keep games going, the staff team has taken the long-awaited action of implementing cross-faction battlegrounds. 
To avoid the confusion of tauren fighting alongside gnomes, players placed on the opposite faction will also be morphed to fit in with their teammates. 
This morphing covers character race, mounts, trinket effects, druid forms, and even battle standard appearances to make players blend with their team.
Whispering opposing faction teammates will work as if they are from your faction normally. Whispering same-faction opponents will be blocked as if they are normally on the other faction.
•	Battleground development
Battlegrounds have been polished through months of rigorous testing and community feedback.
Battlegrounds are configured to easily enable or disable temporary event variants.
•	Spectator NPC
Waiting in the PvP Vendor rooms, players will find a skeleton sitting down in one of the chairs. This NPC will allow players to watch any ranked match at will.
•	Armory
The armory…(continued)
PvE:
•	Dungeons
All cataclysm dungeons have been polished.
Dungeon Finder will be cross-faction without morphing.
Refusing a random dungeon queue will result in a 3 minute deserter.
•	Raids
All cataclysm raids have been polished. 
•	Mythics
Once players have gathered all their best-in-slot gear from Deathwing, the challenge does not stop. Players will be ready to return to the cataclysm 4.0 dungeons for a series of time-limited and increasingly difficult dungeons.
At the end of each level awaits a prize bag containing consumables, cosmetics, mounts, or toys not easily obtainable by other means.
Leveling:
•	x7 rate
•	1-20: cleaned, tested, and polished by development
•	20-80: cleaned, tested (awaiting eventual development)
•	80-85 zones have been cleaned, tested, and polished by development
Store: 
•	Our store will be closed on launch. Items and character services will gradually become available up to item level 353 while ensuring that the store does not allow a competitive edge at any point.
QOL changes: 
•	The auction house on neltharion will be shared between factions for economic stability.
•	Unused heirlooms in the cataclysm database have been added to heirloom vendors for a few thousand gold each as a gold sink.
•	The level requirement to activate a secondary spec has been lowered to 10. The gold cost however has not been lowered, making this utility ideal for players leveling a second character supplied with gold by their first.
•	Items which grant a selection of effects randomly (such as Nogginfogger Elixir) have been altered to not produce duplicate effects before all effects are active.
•	Warpweaver Fazsh has been introduced as a custom transmogrifier inspired by the classic ‘transmog bug’. This NPC will allow a much wider variety of transmogrification options, at a significantly higher price.
