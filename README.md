Project Neltharion, as most recently existed in October 2023.
This project is the result of four years of veteran player collaboration, with a focus on endgame replay value and solving long-standing problems.
We implented features, systems, checks, and rules that never existed on blizzard but made a point to keep the game recognizable on the surface to avoid negative effects on players looking for a strictly blizzlike server.

This release is "final", as there will be no further support by myself or under the Project Neltharion name.
The final product is not perfect, as finding more imperfections than you can fix is a natural part of reverse engineering a game. 
The 4 year changelog may be impressive, but our project also started with a source we felt, at the time, was 'almost' complete before spending 4 years working on it.

I have a few pieces of advice for those looking develop starting with this core:
- Do not hold your breathe waiting for someone else to come fix it for you.
- Do not shy away from breaking stuff in the process of a fix.
- Spend plenty of time skimming existing code, as learning to fix issues is a process that snowballs. 
Once you find or understand a solution to one part of the core, you will remember it and use it as a free step towards another solution later down the line.


For the short list of issues I had in mind from the project's final days, Check the known issues file.
